# golang-practice
Individual practice &amp; tutorials of GoLang

## Local Client steps:
- cd pwd 
- Create a module and [outline relevant dependencies](https://go.dev/doc/modules/managing-dependencies#naming_module) as necessary
    ```go mod init github.com/mleprince018/golang-practice``` 

- for some reason you can't have 2 golang scripts in one directory that have package [name] for some reason??? why is that? 
- vscode will also put out errors on import packages - not all are real errors
